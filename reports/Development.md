# DEVELOPMENT
> Week 1 Progress

The first thing we did was fix our dataset. We realized that a column of the dataset had a parsing error from the original repository that led to inaccurate outputs. The creator's error involved cutting off a character in the code conversions from Wiktionary to the translated related language. So, we were able to download the Wiktionary codes and re-process and parse the data to accurately depict the related language output. However, at the same time we left a bug report on the repo, and the owner also fixed the issue. We will revert back to using their dataset, unless we find another bug that we can fix like the last one.After this, we reconvened in order to propose a concrete and specific plan of how and what we will complete prior to the midpoint check-in. We also set up and utilized the given template folder in order to continue with our project. Finally, we fixed errors in our proposal and got approval.

> Week 2 Progress

For this week, we were able to parse through our data in order to ignore the relationship types we didn't want to include in the graph. Additionally, we loaded the Edges and Nodes into a vector and unordered map, respectively. Then, we were able output the Edges and Nodes into edges and nodes text files, so that we can load in our graph from these files instead of parsing through the raw data over and over again. We also formatted our files better and further designed the layout of our parsing folder specifically. We are currently facing problems with inconsistencies in our dataset with some terms in the native language using the native alphabet, where it reappears in the dataset again with the English alphabet spelling (no accent or special characters). Our goal for next week is to figure out how to overcome this problem through some method of normalization, and load in our graph data from the edges and text files instead of the raw data which should be trivial, and finally make our DFS traversal. For next week we would also like to catch up our testing for both the loading/parsing and the traversal.

> Week 3 Progress

For this week, we were able to fix some bugs in our dataset that involved quotations and line skips that messed up reading in the files and parsing that went undetected, since this was a rare occurrence. We were also able to overcome last weeks problem with special characters, and manually replaced them instead of normalization. We also loaded in our graph data from the edges and text files, and created the final structures for storing and manipulating them through the adjacency list. We also were able to implement the DFS traversal and output the the nodes traversed in order, but no official test cases yet. However, we were able to make some basic test cases for loading/parsing and figure out cmake for catch in our test suite. Our next goal is to finish up testing for DFS, and begin our final algorithms, and get a Makefile for our main executable.

> Week 4 Progress

For the final week of the project, we have both a combination of added algorithms and reworking of existing structures. First, we changed the adjacency list to not only store a vector the children pointers, but also the parents. This is because the IDDFS and Layered Graph Drawing would be much more efficient if we could traverse in both directions from a given node. Because of this, we had to add slight tweaks to DFS, but it still traverses on the directed graph. We were also able to test DFS with great success. Afterwards, we were able to implement and test IDDFS, where we were able to make adjustments to the code based on user ID inputs. When taking in user ID inputs, we also made our graph disregard case by converting everything in our graph to lower case as it is read in. Again because we were handling user input, we also created many checks for invalid nodes, non-existent nodes, different cases, and other weird inputs, like 0 or negative depths in IDDFS. We added a lot of restructuring again to our src file for all of our algorithms and graph, because the headers, cpps, and tests were very unorganized, and now have working cmake/make executibles for our main and test cases. The last thing we are working on is finishing our layered graph drawing, which traverses correctly but doesn't have a perfectly lined up output. Then, we need to add test cases and create our video/final report as our last steps before the due date.
