**CS 225 Data Structures**
\
**Team Contract (effiek2-meghan7-ericrc3-cconley3)**
\
\
**Communication**
* Team Meetings
  * We will meet once a week on Saturdays from 2-4 PM using Discord or in person. We'll rotate taking notes every week, starting with effiek2, who will also be drafting the weekly Development paragraph.
* Assistance
  * We have a Discord group chat and a text group chat. We should try to respond to each within the day. 
* Respect
  * We can have a debrief at the end of each meeting to just put any opinions or questions on the floor. We can also have the note-taker have a higher responsiblity for that meeting to paying attention that everyone gets their opinions out.

**Collaboration**
* Work Distribution
  * At the end of each meeting we will assign and distribute work for the upcoming week. If for some reason someone has a very busy week ahead of them, we can try to balance it so that they have less, but then the next week they do more. That way, over the entire duration, everyone does a similar amount of work, even if it varies from week to week.
* Time Commitment
  * We agree that each person should work 2-6 hours a week. We will discuss prior time commitments the meeting before so that we can redistribute work appropriately. Any new conflicts or commitments we can discuss in the group chat and see if other people for the group can pick up the slack, or we can see if we need to reevaluate our goals and progress for the week. 
* Conflict Resolution
  * For the most part, we will try to do a vote, which will work as long as it is not a tie. Otherwise, people can either try to make their case, but if no one is swaying, then we can do rock paper scissors. If someone didn't finish their work, we will discuss at the meetings how to either help them complete their work, or figure out what they need in order to be successful. Same with if someone is habitually late, we will discuss what the problem is: do we need to change our time or mode of communication?
